// VENDORED from @chatpanel/events/subject-name.js — edit there, then copy over.
// Naming a subject, and when one is big enough to deserve a page.
//
// The small, dependency-free half of subject identity: fold a name to its canonical form,
// strip the decoration a directory hangs off it, and hold the evidence thresholds. Nothing
// here resolves aliases, proposes merges or reaches for a Levenshtein — that is `entity.js`,
// which imports this.
//
// The split is a load-time one, and it is the third time the lesson has come up here (see
// `distance.js` and `redaction-tokens.js`). `knowledge.js` needs exactly `normalizeSubject`
// to build a brief id, and the extension's brief store needs exactly `DEFAULT_THRESHOLD` —
// and both are on the MV3 service worker's graph. Reaching them through `entity.js` put
// entity resolution and merge suggestion on a worker that will never run either.
