// VENDORED from @chatpanel/events/extraction.js — edit there, then copy over.
// The extractions every client needs — topics, entities, suggested prompts.
//
// These three were written inside the extension, one at a time, each with its own hand-typed
// prompt and its own defensive parser. None of them is about a browser: a mobile client
// tagging a note, the gateway redacting a request before it leaves the machine and the bridge
// summarising a transcript all ask the same questions and need the same answers. Three
// implementations of one question drift into three different answers, so they live here.
//
// What is genuinely client-side stays there: WHICH model to ask, how to stream it, where to
// store the result. This module is the contract — the schema, the prompt rendered from it,
// and the reading of the reply — with no clock, no network and no platform API.
//
// Every parser here is the shared coercer from structured.js, so the repairs are the same
// ones: a code fence, a prose preamble, single quotes, a trailing comma, a key spelled
// differently, a markdown list where an array was asked for, and an answer that has not
// finished arriving. A lesson learned by any one of these is learned by all of them.
