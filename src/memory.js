/**
 * MEMORY — the small set of durable facts about the user that every model should already know.
 *
 * ChatPanel remembers conversations, meetings and notes, and can search all of them. What it
 * could not do is KNOW anything. Told "call me Alex, and never open with a preamble", the next
 * turn — let alone the next agent, or Codex over MCP — started from zero, because the only way
 * a fact survived was for someone to search for it, and nobody searches for their own name.
 *
 * Memory is the opposite of history by design. History is large, retrieved, and about events.
 * Memory is SMALL, ambient, and about standing truths — so it can be carried into every turn
 * instead of looked up, and so a person can read the whole of it in one screen and correct it.
 * That size limit is the feature: a memory that grows without bound becomes a second corpus,
 * and a second corpus needs search, and then nothing is ambient any more.
 *
 * Four properties make it work the same everywhere:
 *
 *   ONE VOCABULARY. Five kinds, closed set. `identity` and `preference` are AMBIENT — they
 *   apply to every turn, so they are carried unconditionally. `project`, `fact` and
 *   `reference` are RETRIEVED, because "the staging cluster is in Frankfurt" is only worth
 *   tokens on a turn that mentions it. One rule decides which, in `recall`, so the extension,
 *   the gateway and a future mobile client cannot disagree about what the model was told.
 *
 *   CAPTURE IS DETERMINISTIC. `candidatesFrom` reads a string. No model call, no network, no
 *   latency, on every user message — which is the only reason it can run on every user
 *   message. It separates what the user COMMANDED ("remember that…") from what they merely
 *   REVEALED ("I prefer…"), because those deserve different answers: the first is consent,
 *   the second is a guess, and a guess must be offered rather than acted on.
 *
 *   WRITES RECONCILE, THEY DO NOT ACCUMULATE. Saying "call me Alex" twice must leave one
 *   memory, and saying "actually, call me Sam" must leave one memory with the new value and
 *   the old one recoverable. `reconcile` decides create/update/duplicate against what is
 *   already stored; a client that just pushes rows produces a list nobody can read by week
 *   two.
 *
 *   THE PROMPT FORM IS SHARED. `memoryBlock` is the one rendering. If the extension wrote its
 *   own the model would be told something subtly different depending on which surface the
 *   user typed into, and the bug would be invisible.
 *
 * Class R: pure, dependency-free, no I/O. Persistence is the host's (chrome.storage in the
 * extension, an encrypted file in the gateway) — the same split as `store.js`.
