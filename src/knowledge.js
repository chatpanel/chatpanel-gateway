// VENDORED from @chatpanel/events/knowledge.js — edit there, then copy over.
// BRIEFS — the derived layer. A statement about a SUBJECT that accumulates across records.
//
// Everything else ChatPanel stores is a record of an event: a chat happened, a call
// happened, a human wrote a note. Nothing is a synthesis, so every answer is re-derived
// from scratch, every session, forever — and a multi-agent run's findings die with the run.
// A brief is the thing that compounds.
//
// FOUR INVARIANTS, and they are the whole defence (see docs/knowledge-compounding.md §5.1):
//
//   I-K1  Every claim cites raw. A claim with no ref is a BUG, not a weak claim — it is
//         refused on write. Derived text can then always be checked against, or rebuilt
//         from, the immutable records under it.
//   I-K2  A brief is REBUILDABLE. Delete every brief and this module reconstructs them from
//         the record store. That makes a brief a projection — the same guarantee replay()
//         gives the event log — and it makes "rebuild all" a cache clear, not data loss.
//   I-K3  Nothing self-promotes. `draft` is free; `promoted` needs a gate. Class-R
//         derivations may auto-promote (a backlink is not an opinion); model-written prose
//         may not. Unreviewed agent writing compounding into confident nonsense is the
//         failure mode that is undetectable six months later.
//   I-K4  Bounded, or it is a second corpus. A brief has a size ceiling and the SET of
//         briefs has a count ceiling driven by evidence — memory.js already made this
//         argument for memory, and the same sentence applies here.
//
// This phase (W1) is entirely class R: no model, no network, no clock of its own. Every
// claim is something the corpus already states — who was present, when, what co-occurs,
// what the user themselves told us. Prose synthesis arrives in W3, behind the gate, and
// lands as `proposed` beside these rather than replacing them.
//
// WHY THIS FILE IS THE MODEL AND `knowledge-derive.js` IS THE PASS. Reading a brief and
// BUILDING one have very different costs: reading needs the shape and the renderer, while
// building walks the whole corpus and needs entity resolution and the maintenance passes.
// The MV3 service worker only ever reads — it syncs stored briefs to the gateway — so
// putting both halves in one module would have put 60 KB of derivation on its cold start
// for code it never runs. The split is what keeps that honest rather than remembered.

// From subject-name.js, not entity.js: this module is on the MV3 service worker's graph and
// needs exactly one string function, where entity.js also carries alias resolution and merge
// suggestion. Same argument as the knowledge/knowledge-derive split, one level down.
